# Financial Market Trading Dashboard

Create a streamlit application with multiple pages of what might be useful to a trader / investor.

Currently, we plan to have the following:

- A index & the sector based chart across different timelines to get a macro view.

- A stock screener like in yahoo finance (we want to limit the pool to nasdaq 100 for simplicity).

- An algo back testing feature that can run on the above pool of stocks with customizable dates.
